Trello iOS Assisted Onboarding
==============================

This project is a simple iOS App that hosts the Trello iOS Assisted Onboarding screens. The code was written using
an MVVM architecture with RxSwift in a declarative/stateless style.

This code was open-sourced to provide a bigger example of production code that uses Reactive Programming in more complex ways.

The code also takes advantage of iOS accessibility features and works at all dynamic type sizes and supports voice-over and iOS 13 voice control.
